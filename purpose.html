    <p>The purpose of an automated payroll application is to keep track of the attendance as well as payroll (salary) of the employees in an organization. In such
an organization, employees are constantly deployed on site at various client
locations. Hence, the location of the employees needs to be tracked by the organization in order to calculate their attendance and payroll. The advantage of
having such an application is manifold as explained below:
</p>
